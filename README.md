# Retinal-OCT-Image-classification
Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients.Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN). There are 84,495 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 4 categories (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN)..I have applied Inception, VGG16 and AlexNet for classfication and i have also applied trasfer learning approach for better performance
