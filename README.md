# Retinal-OCT-Image-classification
Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients.Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time

In Retinal optical coherence tomography there are four types like 'DRUSEN', 'CNV', 'NORMAL' and 'DME'.I have applied Inception, VGG16 and AlexNet for classfication and i have also applied trasfer learning approach for better performance
